Why Emacs
Emacs helps you be productive by providing an integrated environment for many different kinds of tasks:
All of the basic editing commands(and there are lots of them) are available no matter what you are trying to do: write code, read a manual, use a shell, or compose an email.
All the tools Emacs provides for opening, saving, searching and processing text (and more) are available to you no matter what you're doing.
This uniformity means that working with Emacs is often easier than learning to use a separate program, especially when that program is liable to have its own set of editing capabilities and shortcuts.
